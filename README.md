hello-world
===========

Spending a little time at home working in Blender and now learning about Git. The reason I have been spending time at home is due to a heart attack I had October 02, 2014.

Checking to see if Fixes is required or if I can use issue and the number.

Anothr quick fix

Yes Fixes is required. Don't know why that would be when they are called issues. I guess Issues and Fixes go hand in hand.
